## Inspiration
All of us use open source software in our everyday life. But how cool would it be if we can contribute back it. Contributing to open source is a way of giving back to the ever helpful tech community that has helped millions start their journey in the tech industry for free. Contribution to open source is great feeling for both beginners and experts of the field. 
Contribution to real world projects will boost the confidence of beginners who would otherwise be wasting their time watching endless tutorial videos on YouTube. Experts/Pro can give give back to the community by putting use their experience.
Currently there is no platform to search open source projects to contribute to. We decided to do something about it. We wanted to build a platform where any person can choose a project that we wants to contribute to based on the difficulty level. That's how **Community Star** was born.

## How it works?
Anyone can sign-up on the website using _Github_ and list their project or search for projects to start contributing to. We don't discriminate people based on their knowledge or experience. Beginners with very little knowledge or experts are all the same to us. We are just looking for people with passion to contribute to _Open source software_. 
After signing up people can browse through all the projects that have been listed on the site. Then they can take a look at the technologies used and the _Github_ page of the project to decide if they want to contribute to it. All the projects they volunteer to contribute show up in their dashboard.

## What's next for Community Star
Going forward we would like to implement features like rewarding contributors with badges to showcase it to the world, create a leader board of people with highest contributions in a week/month/year. Features such as workshops and tutorials from experienced developers to help novice developers get started with their contribution can also be added.
